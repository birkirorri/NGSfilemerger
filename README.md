# NGSfilemerger
This application allows you to merge the files you need based on the sample and R number. 
The comments in the code are in Icelandic since this was made to help my lab save time in their work (which were all icelandic) 


Please contact me if you want the english version 

How to use: 

#1
Run the exe file and choose the folder where all the files are where you want them to merge together.

#2 
Wait...

#3 
Should display what files were merged together and if they did so successfully
