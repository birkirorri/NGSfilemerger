# NGS filemerger for Archer files

This application allows you to merge the files you need based on the sample and R number 
The comments in the code are in Icelandic since this was made to help my lab back home to save some time in manual labour 


# How to use: 

##1
Run the exe file (or the py) and choose the folder where all the files are where you want them to merge together.

##2 
Wait...

#3 
Should display what files were merged together and if they did so successfully
